1. Perfume Project
A data science project analyzing perfume data using Python. It includes:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Visualizations with matplotlib and seaborn
- Machine learning models for classification/recommendation

Detailed Description
This project analyzes sales data of various perfumes across different categories, regions, and months. It includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and a time series forecasting model to predict future sales.

Dataset: Public Kaggle perfume dataset with Product, Category, Unit Price, Units Sold, Region, Month, and Total Sales.

Tools: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, scikit-learn, Prophet

Highlights:
- Identified top-selling products and analyzed sales trends by category, region, and month.
- Built Linear Regression and Random Forest models for sales prediction.
- Developed a Prophet time series model to forecast future perfume sales.
- Provided actionable insights for inventory and marketing planning.
